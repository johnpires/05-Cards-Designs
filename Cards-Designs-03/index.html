                <h1>John Wick 3</h1>
                <p>
                    After gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy international assassin's guild --
                    legendary hit man John Wick finds himself stripped of the organization's protective services. Now
                    stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York
                    as he becomes the target of the world's most ruthless killers.

                    If you have a problem and there is nowhere else to turn, the mysterious and elusive Robert McCall
                    will deliver the vigilante justice you seek. This time, however, McCall's past cuts especially close
                    to home when thugs kill Susan Plummer -- his best friend and former colleague. Now out for revenge,
                    McCall must take on a crew of highly trained assassins who'll stop at nothing to destroy him
